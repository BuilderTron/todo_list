Todo List source code.

This is the basic bare bones of a todo list web app that will be
transformed into an app to track different types of projects and
assignments for educators and students.

Educators will be able to track what their students are doing in realtime
know when the student is done with their assignments.
Students will also have the ability to ask questions within the app.

The todo_list will also include a reminder in the future.
